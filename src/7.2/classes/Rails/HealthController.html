<p>Built-in Health Check Endpoint</p>

<p>Rails also comes with a built-in health check endpoint that is reachable at the <code>/up</code> path. This endpoint will return a 200 status code if the app has booted with no exceptions, and a 500 status code otherwise.</p>

<p>In production, many applications are required to report their status upstream, whether it‚Äôs to an uptime monitor that will page an engineer when things go wrong, or a load balancer or Kubernetes controller used to determine a pod‚Äôs health. This health check is designed to be a one-size fits all that will work in many situations.</p>

<p>While any newly generated Rails applications will have the health check at <code>/up</code>, you can configure the path to be anything you‚Äôd like in your <code>&quot;config/routes.rb&quot;</code>:</p>

<pre><code>Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get &quot;healthz&quot; =&gt; &quot;rails/health#show&quot;, as: :rails_health_check
end
</code></pre>

<p>The health check will now be accessible via the <code>/healthz</code> path.</p>

<p>NOTE: This endpoint does not reflect the status of all of your application‚Äôs dependencies, such as the database or Redis cluster. Replace <code>&quot;rails/health#show&quot;</code> with your own controller action if you have application specific needs.</p>

<p>Think carefully about what you want to check as it can lead to situations where your application is being restarted due to a third-party service going bad. Ideally, you should design your application to handle those outages gracefully.</p>
