<h1 id="label-Action+Mailbox">Action Mailbox</h1>

<p>Action Mailbox routes incoming emails to controller-like mailboxes for processing in Rails. It ships with ingresses for Mailgun, Mandrill, Postmark, and SendGrid. You can also handle inbound mails directly via the built-in Exim, Postfix, and Qmail ingresses.</p>

<p>The inbound emails are turned into <code>InboundEmail</code> records using Active Record and feature lifecycle tracking, storage of the original email on cloud storage via Active Storage, and responsible data handling with on-by-default incineration.</p>

<p>These inbound emails are routed asynchronously using Active Job to one or several dedicated mailboxes, which are capable of interacting directly with the rest of your domain model.</p>

<p>You can read more about Action Mailbox in the <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_mailbox_basics.html">Action Mailbox Basics</a> guide.</p>
