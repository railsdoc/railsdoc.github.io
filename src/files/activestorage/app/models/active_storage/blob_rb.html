<p>A blob is a record that contains the metadata about a file and a key for where that file resides on the service. Blobs can be created in two ways:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>Ahead of the file being uploaded server-side to the service, via <code>create_and_upload!</code>. A rewindable <code>io</code> with the file contents must be available at the server for this operation.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Ahead of the file being directly uploaded client-side to the service, via <code>create_before_direct_upload!</code>.</p>
</li></ol>

<p>The first option doesn&#39;t require any client-side JavaScript integration, and can be used by any other back-end service that deals with files. The second option is faster, since you&#39;re not using your own server as a staging point for uploads, and can work with deployments like Heroku that do not provide large amounts of disk space.</p>

<p>Blobs are intended to be immutable in as-so-far as their reference to a specific file goes. You&#39;re allowed to update a blob&#39;s metadata on a subsequent pass, but you should not update the key or change the uploaded file. If you need to create a derivative or otherwise change the blob, simply create a new blob and purge the old one.</p>
